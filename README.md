# moving-repos

This script will move a git repository into another as a subdirectory while keeping git history.

## Instructions

* Setup your destination repository (maindir) on the same level as the script. i.e. both on the desktop.
* cd to desktop (or the folder your working in)
* Run the script by running ./move in terminal and follow prompts
* The script will clone the repository you wish to move into the main directory as a sub directory, so no need to worry about cloning it beforehand
* Once the script has run, you will need to push to your remote, should you wish to do so and delete the folders you no longer wish to keep
